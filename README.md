# Advanced Ruby: Deconstructing a mock object library

This talk is not about testing. Nor is it really about mocking. However,
analyzing a mock object library is a great way to showcase advanced Ruby
topics.

Have you ever wondered exactly how a mock object library does what it does? You
*can* understand it!

This talk uses a simplified mock object library as the basis for delving into
topics such as metaprogramming and the Ruby object model.

The goal is to increase the knowledge of these topics in the Ruby community.
With this know-how, you will be better suited to build from and contribute to
common Ruby tools that use them.
